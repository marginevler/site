    <h1>
        Margi Nevler
    </h1>
    You are moonlight, keep me safe as I walk home.<br>
    The waxing gibbous looming fallow - she's my enemy.<br>
    I'm glad some part of me knew that's the last kiss we'd have, for a handful of moons.<br>
    Your sea was all tranquility - well, that's where we'd begin.<br><br>
